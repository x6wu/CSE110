# TritonTravel


Students new to UC San Diego often find it hard to navigate such a large campus: Most transit apps do not include UCSD shuttle lines and the live shuttle map provided by the Transportation Services office is counterintuitive, outdated, and provides little information. TritonTravel integrates live information provided by Google Maps with campus shuttle lines to offer our users more options. Start to navigate both on and off campus with TritonTravel!

### System Requirements
TritonTravel requires a minimum SDK version of 21, internet connection while using the app, and enabled location service.

### How to Install 
* Download the APK file from [here](https://github.com/x6wu/TritonTravel/tree/mapFragment/app/build/outputs/apk/release) to your phone.
* Open the file on your phone and choose "install".
* Congrats on successfully installing our app and have fun! 


### Known Bugs

* If certain route contains too much information (i.e. too many connection stops), the information may not be properly displayed.
* When TritonTravel is opened for the first time, it asks for access to location service. After granted access, the application has to be re-opened in order to run properly.
